	\begin{itemize}
		\item Unless otherwise stated, all answers must be mathematically justified.
		\item Partial answers will be graded. 
		\item You can work in groups but each student must write his/her own solution based on his/her own understanding of the problem. Please list on your submission the students you work with for the homework (this will not affect your grade).
		\item Problems with a $(\star)$ are extra credit, they will not (directly) contribute to your score of this homework. However, for every $4$ extra credit questions successfully answered your lowest homework score get replaced by a perfect score.
		\item If you have any questions, feel free to contact me (\texttt{lm4271@nyu.edu}) or to stop at the office hours.
